					<a name="intro"></a>
					<p>
						Before truly beginning our brief analysis on the impact of the current administration on the nation’s economy 
						with respect to job creation and wage growth, it is important to note that many of the driving factors for these 
						economic indicators are entirely outside the control of the presidency. While regulations imposed or relaxed by 
						the executive branch do play some role in boosting, or inhibiting for that matter, the economy, the overall role 
						of these regulations is comparatively small to the potential policies passed by Congress or pursued by the 
						relatively independent federal agency, the Federal Reserve Board. In spite of this political limitation of the 
						power of the presidency over the nation’s economy, due to the incredibly ambitious promises made over the 
						course of the campaign cycle, it is important to evaluate the current administration as to serve as a check on 
						their ability to return on these promises.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also acknowledge that there are multiple ways to evaluate the U.S. economy. In fact, the careers of 
						thousands of economists exist to do just this task and to construct new indicators of economic performance. 
						To this end, we note that our analysis is intentionally limited to focus on the raw statistics released by 
						the nonpartisan U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Furthermore, while a longitudinal evaluation of the 
						labor market may be more informative, we restrict our analysis to two datasets released in the second quarter 
						of 2016 and 2017. <a href = https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-presidents-first-100-days-really-do-matter/>Data suggests</a> 
						that the first one-hundred days in office strongly indicate the overall productivity and capacity to produce 
						meaningful results in office. Therefore, if data provided by the BLS indicate growth in jobs and wages, 
						perhaps the administration’s campaign promises were not a ruse after all.

						<a href = “https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z1ebjpgk2654c1_&met_y=unemployment_rate&hl=en&dl=en”>Many 
						different sources</a> on both sides of the political aisle verify that the U.S. unemployment rate continues to 
						fall in the wake of the 2007-2010 economic recession. However, looking more closely at the underlaying formula 
						for the unemployment rate highlights a number of key omissions that shroud this supposedly simple statistic in 
						uncertainty. Most importantly, individuals who do not seek employment for a certain period of time due to a 
						perceived lack of opportunity or lack of employable skills are not included in the unemployment rate. Similarly, 
						indivudals who retire early due to a company-wide buy-out that shrinks the work force are also not technically 
						counted as unemployed. For these and countless other reasons, job creation may be a better indicator of economic 
						performance. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To evaluate the overall impact of the current administration over the past year, we limit the scope of our 
						analysis to 385 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) which comprise the majority of major U.S. cities. 
						Therefore, while our analysis omits large swaths of rural America, 
						<a href = “https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/04/is-this-the-ultimate-2016-presidential-election-map/521622/”>which 
						overwhelmingly supported the current administration during its campaign</a>, these 385 MSAs constitute the largest 
						easily monitored portion of economic activity in the United States. 
					</p>
					<p>
						With this in mind, our analysis indicates that the majority of MSAs in the United States saw employment rise 
						under the first year of the Trump administration. Specifically, the largest MSAs saw the greatest gross 
						increase in employment as indicated in the chart below:

					<p>
						However, this success with respect to job creation was not experienced unilaterally across the United States. 
						In fact, the top ten <i>worst</i> performing MSAs under the first year of the Trump administration actually saw 
						a net outflow of jobs. While some of these MSAs are also quite large cities, such as Atlanta, Seattle, and Las 
						Vegas, many of the others on the chart below are comparatively smaller MSAs. For this reason, the outflow of 
						jobs from these already smaller local economies likely produced harsh economic consequences for the residents of 
						these areas.

						Finally, to fully capture how the 385 MSAs in our data set are performing compared to one another, we present 
						our final plot related to employment. The plot below details how each MSA’s Employment Quotient changed from 
						2016 to 2017. Employment Quotients are ratios that enable researchers and policymakers to compare MSAs with 
						vastly different local economies and demographics. Therefore, MSAs with Employment Quotients greater than 
						1.00 employ more individuals than their respective economies would suggest while Quotients less than 1.00 
						suggest under-performance with respect to the level of employment within the MSA. Visually, we can identify 
						MSAs that improved over the past year by identifying any MSA that lies above the Perfectly Distributed 
						Employment Trend Line in the plot below:

					<p>
						While committing one’s campaign and time in office to job creation would pose quite a challenge to any 
						administration, the campaign promises of <a href = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/i-will-give-you-everything-here-are-282-of-donald-trumps-campaign-promises/2016/11/24/01160678-b0f9-11e6-8616-52b15787add0_story.html?utm_term=.d24ca8a8fa09>
						the current executive also promised significant wage growth </a>. Wage growth in the United States has 
						perplexed economists ever since the unofficial end of the Great Recession in mid-2010. With the 
						unemployment rate falling to historic levels, labor economics would suggest that wages should begin to 
						rise. <a href = https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/05/05/april-jobs-report-trump-wage-growth-000433>
						However, this unfortunately did not occur during the Obama Administration</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since wages already vary significantly across the United States, displaying the top-performing MSAs with 
						respect to wage growth would not reveal very meaningful insights. However, Wage Quotients, which operate 
						essentially the same as the Employment Quotients defined above, indicate which MSAs are performing better 
						under the Trump administration in its first year. Again, MSAs that lie above the Perfectly Distributed Wage 
						Trend Line are performing better with respect to wage growth than MSAs that either lie on the line or below it.

						Finally, it’s helpful to drill down into changes in weekly wages to better understand how the current 
						administration’s economic policies may be affecting the “average American.” Furthermore, providing a 
						geographic component to this metric may further inform who the “winners” and “losers” of the Trump era 
						may be. With this said, we present our finding related to the average change in weekly wages in each of 
						the 385 MSAs in our BLS data set below: 
						<br>
						<iframe width="850" height="620" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://fusiontables.google.com/embedviz?q=select+col25+from+1b_0wCXnluyFEEKveVvX7lCPh3b46PJ7oHLajWMju&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=37.257125002898455&amp;lng=-86.99115452500001&amp;t=1&amp;z=4&amp;l=col25&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=TWO_COL_LAT_LNG"></iframe>
						<br>
						As indicated in our map, the majority of MSAs experienced positive wage growth of greater than $20 per 
						week. We do note, however, that <a href = https://www.statista.com/statistics/244983/projected-inflation-rate-in-the-united-states/>
						MSAs experiencing wage growth less than $20 per week fail to be increasing at the rate of inflation in 
						the United States</a>. Therefore, even stagnant wages pose a threat to the current administration and 
						the American population in general. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall, the information presented by the BLS in the form of our data set sends mixed signals on the 
						impact of the current administration on the U.S. economy and particularly on the labor market. While 
						the included 385 MSAs certainly seem to be thriving under the policies of the past year, much of this 
						economic momentum may easily be attributed to the economic policies established during the past 
						administration. Similarly, a handful of MSAs are seeing wages increase at an above-inflation rate, yet 
						in general, wages overwhelmingly remained constant over the past year. Therefore, at this point, it is 
						difficult to determine if the current administration is indeed <i>making American jobs great again</i> 
						or is riding the momentum of past economic policies that made American jobs great in the first place
